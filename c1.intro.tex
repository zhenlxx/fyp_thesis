\section{Objective}
The objective of this project is to develop an week-type interpreted language using Haskell.This language is able to support the following feature,
\begin{itemize}
\item basic for loop and while loop
\item basic if-else statement
\item functional invocation 
\item arbitrary dimension array
\item polymorphic array
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, in project,the monadic design approach is applied as Haskell is different from other object oriented language.

\section{Introduction to Haskell} 
Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language.By applying the used of Haskell to this project ,I have significantly  reduce the coding time and spent most of my time to the design phrase.


\section{Methodology}
Agile development methodology is used in the entire development process.This project has been initially identified multiple iteration and each iteration contains three major stages research , development and testing.
