\item basic for loop and while loop
\item basic if-else statement
\item functional invocation 
\item multi-dimension array
\item polymorphic array
\end{itemize}

What's more,

\section{Haskell} 
Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language.


\section{Methodology}
Agile development methodology is used in the entire development process.This project has been initially identified multiple iteration and each iteration contains three major stages   research , development and testing.
