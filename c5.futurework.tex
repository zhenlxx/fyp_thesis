\chapter{Future Work and Project Plan}
\section{Future Work}
I have done most of the research work of the project.the future work will be implementing the actual parser.There will be an initial implementation of part of the EBNF definition.The execution engine will be implemented at the same as the parser.Due to Haskell have a powerful abstraction mechanism and a suitable library (Parsec),the implementation will not be too difficult.

The major barrier will be implementing the execution engine since I have no knowledge about it.
There will be more research in the later stage of this project on the interpreter part as well as the grammar and Haskell part.

\section{Project Plan}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.00\textwidth}|}

\hline \textbf{Before November} \\
I have finish most of research on Chomsky's 
CFG grammar and Haskell.I have started to implement a prototype of the interpreter.\\

\hline \textbf{November 12 to November 26}\\
Research on the execution engine of the interpreter.\\
\hline \textbf{November 12 to November 31} \\
Development a prototype by following the documentation of parsec. The document  "Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours/Parsing" offer an example to implements a interpreter for Scheme using parsec library of Haskell.\\
\hline
\textbf{November 31 to January 15} \\
Implement a subset of EBNF specification of $yun$.Add the error checking to the interpreter.Meantime,as the code growing ,unit test will be added to guarantee the quality of existing code.
\\
\hline  \textbf{January 16 to February 15}\\
Implement all the EBNF specification of $yun$\\
\hline   \textbf{February 31 to March 15}\\
Implement the IO command (library).Add more test code.\\
\hline \textbf{February 16 to March 16}\\
Review the EBNF of $yun$ programming language.Implement more library for it.Start the system testing.
\\ 
\hline \textbf{March 17 to April 8}\\
Prepare for the project fair.\\
