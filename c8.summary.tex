\section{Analysis}
In the initial stage of this project,lots of possibility has been considered ,for instance,the parsec parser library and happy parser generator library.What's more, I also need to design which this programming language need to be a static type of dynamic type language.As there is lots of debate in pros and cons on various type system, I make the choice simple base on the difficult of implementation of a certain manifold.\\

The puerility and monad also help me a lot in writing this project.In this project,on a small amount of function is pure and most of other are monadic function as in this project,I made use of the monadic design approach.The monadic design approach helps me to limit to side-effect into monad and I can specify to limit the type of side-effect.
\\

Above all,Haskell is a suitable language to do this project which is a important reason for the success of this project.



\section{Conclusion}
Haskell is a high-level language and provide a lots of tools to glue functions together thus can implements functionality elegantly.\\

Haskell's type system has placed numerous restrictions on my code and it turn out to be when I try to implements something new in project , most of time, when I passed the compiling phrase I can have correct implementation.\\

In the passed three years, I have learnt quit few of programming language.By doing this project,I can be on a on the side of language design rather than a user, to review other languages' features and characteristic I have leant.It allows me that think about how a language is implemented and why it was implemented this way.\\

There are great amount of disputes on pros and cons between different programming languages.Those disputes, to a large extend, have ignored the fact that programming languages are created for computer scientist to resolve problem.




\section{Future Work}
This project can be extended to a Domain-specific language (DSL) which is a language designed delicately to particular program domain.Logo a dialect of Lisp and was created for education purpose.This language allow programming to draw shapes on the screen.To build a DSL,a research needed to be conduct for a specified domain ,additional syntax support and library needed to be added into the language.\\\\
With Haskell powerful support abstraction support like monad , high-order function and function composition, implementing a language is not so painful.
Though the current project is only focus on a generic purpose language , other people has implemented lots of  Domain-specific language hosted by Haskell runtime,for instance ,KURE is a Haskell hosted Domain-specific Language (DSL) for writing transformation systems based on rewrite strategies[A Haskell Hosted DSL for Writing Transformation Systems].\\\\
A DSL is created for resolving problem that is easy to design and tedious to implements and Haskell is the best candidate to do this job.
