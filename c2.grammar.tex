\section{The Hierarchy of Grammars}
Noam Chomsky has describe three model of grammar ["Three models for the description of language"]  and this grammar model has significantly effect the design of computer programming language.


Chomsky define a set of rule upon the formal grammar and categorize them into different levels.

A formal grammar of this type consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a finite set of terminal symbols.
\item a finite set of non-terminal symbols.
\item a finite set of project rules.
\item a start symbol.
\end{itemize}

From previous formal grammar definition, legitimate production rules can be written as 
 \[ S \mapsto aS  \,and \, S \mapsto ab \]
 
In this example,we can assume that the grammar consists of two projection rules and the starting symbol is $ S $.The terminal symbols are lower letters $ \{a ,b\} $ . From this example, If we start from the either rule 1 or rule 2 ,we could derive a  grammar of $ \{ a^n b | n>1  \}$ ,which can be enumerate like $ \{aab,aaab,aaaab,\cdots \} $.

The Chomsky hierarchy consists of the 4 levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Type-0 grammars. It is a unrestricted grammars that include all.
\item Type-1 grammars.
\item Type-2 grammars.
\item Type-3 grammars.
\end{itemize}
