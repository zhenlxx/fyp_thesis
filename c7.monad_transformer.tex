\chapter{Monad Transformers}

Monad transformers offer an additional benefit to monadic programming: by providing a
library of different monads and types and functions for combining these monads, it is possible
to create custom monads simply by composing the necessary monad transformers. [Monad Transformers Step by Step]In real world application, it is often the case that a combination different type of action is required to put into one function.Monad transformer provide a new way to glue them together.

\section{State Transformer}
A value of type \textbf{(ST a s)} is a computation which transforms a state index by type s ,and delivers a value of type a ,You can think of it as a box ,like this
