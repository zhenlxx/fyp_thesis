\subsection{Dynamic Typing and Static Typing}
A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time. 
For example , you have to specify the type explicitly and the compile will the the type correctness of a variable.A variable of a specified type can not assign to another value of other type.

\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}|p{5cm}}
\hline
Static Typing & Dynamic Typing \\
\hline
int a =1;\par \textbf{/*a is of type int */} \par int a="a string"; \par \textbf{ /* its not valid to assign a string to a variable that has type int */} & a=1; \par \textbf{/* does not need to specified a type for this variable */} \par a ="a string"; \par
\textbf{/* it valid to change the type of the variable */} \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular} \\\\
In my project, I used the dynamic typing scheme,which is ,does not need to specify any type of variable and able to assign any type of primitives to a variable.
